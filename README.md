# zig-squashfs

This is my experiments to learn Zig. Might amount to something. Might not.

## Current State

Kinda works as a library, but currently has known memory leaks. `unsquashfs` is missing a lot of features (and will probably never match the official unsquashfs). Extraction is stupidly slow and uses too many resources.
